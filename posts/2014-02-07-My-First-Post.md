Today I decided to submit Standing Novation as my idea for DevArt.

Last year, I took part in the 3 Beards Art Hack. One of the "prizes" was for your hack to be exhibited in the Barbican as part of Hack The Barbican. Where the hack would be on display for two weeks in a small section of the Barbican.

I contacted Novation and I asked the if I could borrow 16 Launchpads. To my surprise they were more than happy to lend me 16.

For those that don't know, a Launchpad is a MIDI controller with a grid of 64 LED lit buttons. I hacked together various node scripts to get a way to control a grid of launchpads from both the perspective of lighting them up, and capturing presses.

Unfortunately straight after the hackday I had to fly to San Francisco for various Twilio company events. Whilst I was away Rob Belgrave & Steve Green kindly constructed a stand for the 16 launchpads. The evening I returned back to London was the start of the Barbican exhibition. Which meant I had very little time in between the hackday and the exhibition to make something I am *truly* proud of. Something that I think can really help people to express their own creativity.

I created some simple "modes" for the launchpad grid but I would love to have the opportunity to not own make Standing Novation bigger and better, but also allow other members of the community to submit their own modes. I will simply be creating a canvas for others to express themselves.

Part of how I'd love to improve it, would be to create a more stable and "polished" stand for the launchpads, and also more launchpads, to create a screen spanning a significant distance.

What say you judges? Please please please le me create the canvas to see something truly magical from the community.
